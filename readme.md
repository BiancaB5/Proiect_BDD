# Project Name: Python BDD Testing Framework


"Python BDD Testing Framework" is a testing framework developed in the Python programming language, utilizing the Behavior Driven Development (BDD) approach to ensure software quality and reliability. Here's a brief overview of the project::

## Project Purpose: 
The primary goal of the project is to provide a robust and easy-to-use framework for testing Python applications. This framework focuses on the BDD approach, which encourages collaboration between development and testing teams by using a common and accessible language that can be understood by all team members.

## Key Features:

-> Integration with popular testing libraries such as Behave or PyTest.

-> Defining test scenarios using the Gherkin syntax, which is easy to read and understand.

-> Using feature files to organize and structure test scenarios.

-> Automated test execution and generation of test reports.

## Project Components:


-> Feature Files: These files contain test scenarios written in Gherkin syntax. Each feature file describes a specific aspect of the application that needs to be tested. In this project I created following feature files: Login, Register, News, Add to cart, Serach and Wish List.

-> Pages: I used the following pages: Base Page, Home page, Login, News, Register, Search results and Wish List Page.

-> Test Steps: These steps represent the concrete implementation of each step in the test scenarios. They are matched to regular expressions defined in the scenarios and are responsible for interacting with the application under test.

-> Configuration and Settings: The component that defines the settings and configurations required to run the tests, such as choosing the browser or other environment parameters.

-> Test Reports: Generating detailed reports about test results, including information about the run scenarios, test steps, and any encountered errors or warnings. I generated the final report file when you will see all the tests.

# Conclusion:
In essence, "Python BDD Testing Framework" is a project that promotes good testing and software development practices through the use of the BDD approach and provides an efficient and reliable way to test Python applications.
